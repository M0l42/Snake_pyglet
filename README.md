# Snake_pyglet

Hi !
Welcome to my project, this is a snake game using pyglet for the 2D and using some path finding algorithm to play on his own.
For the moment you can use A* and Dijkstra algorithm, but to switch it up you need to change the value of path_algo in main and in GameOject ( just replace one by the other )
I'll implement a way to change it while playing.
I'll also try to improve the logic of the algorithm and put some new ones.
